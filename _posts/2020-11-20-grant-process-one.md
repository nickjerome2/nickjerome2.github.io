After careful consideration, the topic I chose for my grant is going to be based around the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.  Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, or MH370 for short, was a commercial passenger flight that disappeared in the middle of the night on March 8th, 2014 en route to Beijing, China.  It was determined after many hours of research and analysis that the resting place of the plane was believed to be somewhere in the Indian Ocean, although to this day, the lost airliner remains missing.  The exact resting place of MH370 is likely to remain a mystery for the time being, as ever since search operations were suspended in 2018, they have yet to resume.

I have always been interested in "unsolved mysteries" such as this one, which is why I had such an easy time researching and learning about MH370.  I plan to create an "interactive map", where important locations, suspected flight paths, and search area coverage is all depicted.  Along with every important spot marked on the map, there will be text explaining the significance of said location, as well as links to other sources so those interested can learn more. When I was doing my research, I came across many websites home to large amounts of information regarding the disappearance of MH370.  Something almost all of them had in common are large walls of text with a severe lack of visuals.  Anyone who genuinely has a passion for stuff like this may not see it as an issue, but to everyone else who is intimidated by said walls of text will be very reluctant to learn more.  That is the goal of this project, to create a learning experience that anyone can enjoy, without excluding the nitty gritty details that are important to understanding this unique case.

One project I found to be quite similar to mine is an "interactive map" created by the Australian Government at arcgis.com (snapshot of map picture below).  While this map is very useful and contains some good information, I found it to have many flaws.  The flaws I noticed while browsing the map created by the Australians are what I hope to improve on in my rendition of this project.  First of all, this map is an absolute nightmare to navigate.  When I pictured my project in my head, I foresaw a map that would have dots/lines across it that are interactable.  This way, you can easily see all the relevant locations at once, which I think is important.  This project forces you to scroll down continuously as the website arbitrarily chooses locations to explain to you.  It is not possible to click on the map yourself, only endlessly scroll, which I found very tedious.  The Australian map also tends to use jargon without fully explaining it.  When the website threw around words like "sea floor spreading" and "breakup zones", I had to tab out to find out what they meant.  In my project, I want to explain everything clearly and concisely to a wide audience, without potentially losing people on complicated jargon.

In short, the project planning has been going quite well so far, and I hope to learn more so I can keep evolving and improving my plan going forward.
