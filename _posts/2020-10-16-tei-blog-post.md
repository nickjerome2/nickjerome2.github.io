title: TEI Blog Post
---

I was assigned Column 2 on page 654 of Charlotte Perkins Stetson’s “The Yellow Wall-paper”.  This project entailed transcribing our portion of the text using TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), a format which uses XML (eXtensible Markup Language).  With my only previous coding experience being the few posts on this blog, I was intimated and overwhelmed before starting this assignment.  Thankfully, as I came to learn, coding in XML certainly was not as difficult as I had made it out to be.  The “TEI on Paper” assignment we completed beforehand, in which we “marked-up” the text in a google doc for practice, really helped visualize what we needed to code.  

The “TEI on Paper” assignment was quite simple.  The first step was making sure the passage we were assigned matched up exactly with the passage as it is in “The Yellow Wall-paper”.  Since my text turned out to match verbatim, I did not need to make any corrections.  After checking for errors, I went through and marked up the document, noting all the places where additional code would be required (example of the document is pictured below).

I definitely struggled with TEI at first.  Upon first opening Oxygen (a program that checks the validity of code), I was completely overwhelmed.  To the untrained eye, Oxygen looks like a mess of multi-colored text, folders, and more buttons than one would know what to do with.  However, despite Oxygen looking intimidating, after Dr. Stover explained the basics, I realized it was a lot more simple than I had originally thought.  Once I understood the basic concept of using beginning and ending tags for everything, the rest was history.  Compared to some of the passages, mine was quite easy.  My portion of the reading only had a few em-dashes and one sentence in italics, while some students had entire pictures with captions.  Since my passage had constant line breaks and short paragraphs, the project was more or less a bunch of copying and pasting lines of text.  This task started out tedious, but as I progressed farther along, started to feel rewarding.  A green square can be shown in the top right of the Oxygen program, letting you know whether the code entered is correct.  While I certainly spent some time looking at a red square (indicating one or more errors), I eventually began seeing only green.  Overall, the coding process seems daunting at first, but is deceptively simple when you get the hang of it.

From something as simple as marking up a google doc, to actually coding in Oxygen, I certainly learned a lot of basics for using TEI to encode documents.  While the project was somewhat tedious, I would definitely say the benefits of learning how to code outweigh the boredom induced from copying and pasting code into Oxygen.  I am excited to see the final product, and hope to be able to learn more about coding in the future.
