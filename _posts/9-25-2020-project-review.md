Hello, everyone.  Today, I will be conducting a review of a little known digital humanities project called "Border Odyssey".

Border Odyssey, is a website (companion to a book by the same name) that depicts the Mexico/U.S. border and all the trials and tribulations that come with it.  The website has a few supporting features to go along with the main course, which is the interactive map.  First off, there is an alphabetized "resources" tab, that catalogs an array of useful and relevant articles/webpages pertinent to the topic at hand.  Another tab houses pictures of over 100 "braceros", who protest weekly in Cuidad Juarez, demanding retirement benefits they earned over half a century ago working for the US & Mexican governments.  Finally, the interactive map provides a closer look at all border cities, including events that have taken place there, laws that have been passed, etc.

I took a decent amount of time to explore the website, and while I noticed a few things that could be improved on, it was generally a very solid experience.  The site is not confusing at all, with all relevant information listed on the sidebar.  The "resources" tab is alphabetized, and even has buttons that will send you partway down the page to a letter you desire.  The links included in the resource tab are all useful, ranging from government agencies that are relevant to the website, to interesting information about that border.  The "braceros" tab includes a couple paragraphs explaining what a bracero is and what they are fighting for, along with a bunch of pictures of ex-braceros, all of which can be clicked on to zoom into.

The centerpiece of the website, the interactive map, is full of great features, although it to, is not void of flaws.  The first thing you see when you click on the "interactive map" button, is a zoomed in shot of the US/Mexico border, with all the border cities clearly marked.  Scrolling from side to side will pan you from west to east, revealing the entire border.  All of the border cities can be clicked on.  Doing so will open up a new tab containing information about the city.  Every tab includes a large picture of the city/landmark near the city, a few paragraphs explaining the relevance of the city, and even a narrator who will read all the information out to you!

While the website is no doubt amazing, it has a few flaws I would like to address.  First off, any time you click on anything pertaining to the interactive map, it opens up a new tab.  While it is not a massive issue, it is pretty inconvenient, I think it would make a lot more sense to keep everything in one tab.  Secondly, I just wish there was more information!  Exploring a new border city can be very rewarding, as each one displays a couple interesting pictures, but I found a lot to be desired as far as the text goes.  There is no question that the information present is interesting, but there just is not enough of it.  Some cities only get four or five lines worth of flavor text.  It might be a testament to the quality of the website that I am complaining about the author not providing enough information.

To wrap things up, I think this website is great.  It is very easy to mess around and spend an hour or two clicking through each city and learning about it.  I recommend that anyone with even a fleeting interest in the US/Mexico border at least check this website out.
